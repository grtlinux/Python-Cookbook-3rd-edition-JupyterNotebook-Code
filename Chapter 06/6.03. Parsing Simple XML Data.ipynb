      "\t<link>https://blog.rtwilson.com/how-to-speed-up-appending-to-postgis-tables-with-ogr2ogr/</link>\n",
      "\t<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary:&lt;/strong&gt; If appending to a PostGIS table with GDAL/OGR is taking a long time, try setting the &lt;code&gt;PG_USE_COPY&lt;/code&gt; config option to &lt;code&gt;YES&lt;/code&gt; (eg. adding &lt;code&gt;--config PG_USE_COPY YES&lt;/code&gt; to your command line). This should speed it up, but beware that if there are concurrent writes to your table at the same time as OGR is accessing it then there could be issues with unique identifiers.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;As with many of my blog posts, I&amp;#8217;m writing this in the hope that it will appear in searches when someone else has the same problem that I ran into recently. In the past I&amp;#8217;ve found myself Googling problems that I&amp;#8217;ve had before and finding a link to my blog with an explanation in a post that I didn&amp;#8217;t even remember writing.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the problem I&amp;#8217;m talking about today is one I ran into when working with a client a few weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;I was using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gdal.org/programs/ogr2ogr.html&quot;&gt;ogr2ogr&lt;/a&gt; command-line tool (part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gdal.org/&quot;&gt;GDAL&lt;/a&gt; software suite) to import data from a local Geopackage file into a PostGIS database (ie. a PostgreSQL database with the PostGIS extension).&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;I had multiple files of data that I wanted to put into one Postgres table. Specifically, I was using the lovely data collated by Alasdair Rae on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://automaticknowledge.co.uk/resources/&quot;&gt;resources&lt;/a&gt; page of his website. Even more specifically, I was using some of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://automaticknowledge.org/gb/&quot;&gt;Local Authority GIS data&lt;/a&gt; to get buildings data for various areas of the UK. I downloaded multiple GeoPackage files (for example, for Southampton City Council, Hampshire County Council and Portsmouth City Council) and wanted to import them all to a &lt;code&gt;buildings&lt;/code&gt; table.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;I originally tested this with a Postgres server running on my local machine, and ran the following ogr2ogr commands:&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ogr2ogr --debug ON \\\n",
      "   -f PostgreSQL PG:&amp;quot;host=localhost user=postgres password=blah dbname=test_db&amp;quot; \\\n",
      "  buildings1.gpkg -nln buildings\n",
      "\n",
      "ogr2ogr -append -update --debug ON \\\n",
      "   -f PostgreSQL PG:&amp;quot;host=localhost user=postgres password=blah dbname=test_db&amp;quot; \\\n",
      "   buildings2.gpkg -nln buildings&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;Here I&amp;#8217;m using the &lt;code&gt;-f&lt;/code&gt; switch and the arguments following it to tell ogr2ogr to export to PostgreSQL and how to connect to the server, giving it the input file of &lt;code&gt;buildings1.gpkg&lt;/code&gt; and using the &lt;code&gt;-nln&lt;/code&gt; parameter to tell it what layer name (ie. table name) to use as the output. In the second command I do exactly the same with &lt;code&gt;buildings2.gpkg&lt;/code&gt; but also add &lt;code&gt;-append&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-update&lt;/code&gt; to tell it to append to the existing table rather than overwriting it.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;This all worked fine. Great!&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;A few days later I tried the same thing with a Postgres server running on Azure (using &lt;a href=&quot;https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/products/postgresql&quot;&gt;Azure Database for PostgreSQL&lt;/a&gt;). The first command ran fine, but the second command seemed to hang.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;I was expecting that it would be a bit slower when connecting to a remote database, but I left it running for 10 minutes and it still hadn&amp;#8217;t finished. I then tried importing the second file to a new table and it completed quickly &amp;#8211; therefore suggesting it was some sort of problem with appending the data.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;I worked round this for the time being (using the &lt;code&gt;ogrmerge.py&lt;/code&gt; script to merge my &lt;code&gt;buildings1.gpkg&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;buildings2.gpkg&lt;/code&gt; into one file and then importing that file), but resolved to get to the bottom of it when I had time.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;Recently, I had that time, and posted on the GDAL mailing list about this. The maintainer of GDAL got back to me to tell me about something I&amp;#8217;d missed in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/pg.html&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;. This was that when importing to a brand new table, the Postgres COPY mode is used, but when appending to an existing table individual INSERT statements are used instead, which can be a lot slower.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s look into this in a bit more detail. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-copy.html&quot;&gt;PostgreSQL COPY command&lt;/a&gt; is a fast way of importing data into Postgres which involves copying a whole file of data into Postgres in one go, rather than dealing with each row of data individually. This can be significantly faster than iterating through each row of the data and running a separate INSERT statement for each row.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;So, ogr2ogr hadn&amp;#8217;t hung, it was just running &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; slowly, as inserting my buildings layer involved running an INSERT statement separately for each row, and there were hundreds of thousands of rows. Because the server was hosted remotely on Azure, this involved sending the INSERT command from my computer to the server, waiting for the server to process it, and then the server sending back a result to my computer &amp;#8211; a full round-trip for each row of the table.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;So, I was told, the simple way to speed this up was to use a configuration setting to turn COPY mode on when appending to tables. This can be done by adding &lt;code&gt;--config PG_USE_COPY YES&lt;/code&gt; to the ogr2ogr command. This did the job, and the append commands now completed nice and quickly. If you&amp;#8217;re using GDAL/OGR from within a programming language, then have a look at the docs for the GDAL bindings for your language &amp;#8211; there should be a way to set GDAL configuration options in your code.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;The only final part of this was to understand why the COPY method isn&amp;#8217;t used all the time, as it&amp;#8217;s so much quicker. Even explained that this is because of potential issues with other connections to the database updating the table at the same time as GDAL is accessing it. It is a fairly safe assumption that if you&amp;#8217;re creating a brand new table then no-one else will be accessing it yet, but you can&amp;#8217;t assume the same for an existing table. The COPY mode can&amp;#8217;t deal with making sure unique identifiers are unique when other connections may be accessing the data. whereas individual INSERT statements can cope with this. Therefore it&amp;#8217;s safer to default to INSERT statements when there is any risk of data corruption.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;As a nice follow-up for this, and on the maintainer&amp;#8217;s advice, I submitted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/pull/9463&quot;&gt;PR&lt;/a&gt; to the GDAL docs, which adds a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/pg.html#updating-existing-tables&quot;&gt;new section&lt;/a&gt; explaining this and giving guidance on setting the config option. I&amp;#8217;ve copied that section below:&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;blockquote&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;When data is appended to an existing table (for example, using the &lt;code&gt;-append&lt;/code&gt; option in ogr2ogr) the driver will, by default, emit an INSERT statement for each row of data to be added. This may be significantly slower than the COPY-based approach taken when creating a new table, but ensures consistency of unique identifiers if multiple connections are accessing the table simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;If only one connection is accessing the table when data is appended, the COPY-based approach can be chosen by setting the config option &lt;code&gt;PG_USE_COPY&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;YES&lt;/code&gt;, which may significantly speed up the operation.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

      "\t<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In October 2023, &lt;a href=&quot;https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2023/10/september-october-board-votes.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;we acknowledged the situation surrounding DjangoCon Africa&lt;/a&gt; and noted our intent to make ongoing improvements to the Grants Program. We also recognize that we are in a new world of hybrid programming since the onset of the pandemic which comes with different funding and cost challenges. One step we are taking to refresh the Grants Program (we’ll be reporting on other steps soon) is to establish PSF Grants Program Office Hours. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The office hours will be hosted on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://discord.gg/7rthGF3BBe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Python Software Foundation Discord&lt;/a&gt; once a month at 1-2PM UTC (9AM Eastern) on the third Tuesday of the month. (Check &lt;a href=&quot;https://dateful.com/time-zone-converter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;what time&lt;/a&gt; that is for you.) We invite the Python community to join in to receive support for Grant-related questions and inquiries! If you have urgent or immediate questions related to the Grants Program, please email grants@pyfound.org.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Direct line of communication&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As we sat down to address the challenges and issues raised around the Grants Program and how to better support the Python community, we came to realize that refreshing the program would not be an easy and quick task. We need a two-way communication channel dedicated to the topic of grants with the PSF Board, the Grants Working Group, the D&amp;amp;I Working Group, the Code of Conduct Working Group, and most importantly, our vibrant and diverse community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We believe a direct line of communication between the PSF and the worldwide Python community is the best first step. In order to create that direct line, gather your feedback, and collaborate on the future of the program, we are establishing regular PSF Grants Program Office Hours! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;What’s the goal?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are a couple of goals we hope to accomplish with the Grants Program Office Hours. In the short term, we believe recurring time supporting communication between the community and the PSF is key. In other words, a place for folks to come with questions and ideas regarding the Grants Program, with an understanding that we don’t have it perfect yet. If we have the answer, or we can point you to the right resource - amazing! If we don’t, that’s an area we know needs more work and will be added to our “To Do.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hope to see the office hours evolve over time as we work through feedback and make updates to our process, documentation, and resources. In the long term, the PSF hopes Grants Program Office Hours will create a place for our community to ask questions about the Grants Program and for us to have (almost) all the answers. We’d like the office hours to continue to be a place where we receive feedback from the community and continuously improve what we can do for Pythonistas around the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;PSF Grants Program Office Hour Hosts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The PSF Grants Program Office Hours will be hosted by members of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.python.org/psf/records/staff/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PSF Staff&lt;/a&gt;. This will change over time, but for now you can expect to see Laura Graves, Senior Accountant, and Marie Nordin, Community Communications Manager, hosting the sessions. When needed, other PSF staff members will sub in for Laura and Marie. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;This sounds great! How can I join?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The PSF Grants Program Office Hours will be a text-only chat based office hour hosted on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://discord.gg/7rthGF3BBe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Python Software Foundation Discord&lt;/a&gt; at 1-2PM UTC (9AM Eastern) on the third Tuesday of the month. The server is moderated by PSF Staff and is locked in between office hour sessions. If you’re new to Discord, check out some &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/sections/360008206871-Discord-Basics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Discord Basics&lt;/a&gt; to help you get started. And as always, if you have urgent or immediate questions related to the Grants Program, please email grants@pyfound.org.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come prepared to the Office Hours with questions and shareable links to your Grant applications drafts in progress via Google docs, etherpad, pastebin, etc. We hope to see you there!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>\n",

      "\t<link>https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2024/03/14/python-3-13-allows-disabling-of-the-gil-subinterpreters/</link>\n",
      "\t<description>&lt;p&gt;Python 3.13 adds the ability to remove the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) per &lt;a href=&quot;https://peps.python.org/pep-0703/&quot;&gt;PEP 703&lt;/a&gt;. Just this past week, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/116338&quot;&gt;PR was merged in&lt;/a&gt; that allows the disabling of the GIL using a command line flag or an environment variable in free-threaded builds. Note that Python must be built using the &lt;code class=&quot;notranslate&quot;&gt;Py_GIL_DISABLED&lt;/code&gt; flag for this to work.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;h2&gt;What is the GIL?&lt;/h2&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;The Global Interpreter Lock makes threading easier in Python and prevents race conditions. It also makes running multiple threads per CPU core impossible. However, you can use the multiprocessing module to at least give you the ability to better utilize the cores on your CPU.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;h2&gt;Removing the GIL&lt;/h2&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;Removing the GIL will likely make Python buggy initially, so they are making the GIL-less version a build flag. That means that the GIL will still be on by default in Python 3.13 while they test the GIL-less version and find all the bugs the change causes. Hopefully, by 3.14 or so, they will know all the bugs and have them fixed to some degree or another.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;h2&gt;Subinterpreters Are Coming&lt;/h2&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;A related enhancement are subinterpreters, which Eric Snow has worked on for quite some time. &lt;a href=&quot;https://peps.python.org/pep-0554/&quot;&gt;PEP 554&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://peps.python.org/pep-0734/&quot;&gt;PEP 734&lt;/a&gt; cover what subinterpreters are and how they are being exposed so you can use them.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s the abstract from PEP 734 to give you an idea of what they are:&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This PEP proposes to add a new module, &lt;code class=&quot;docutils literal notranslate&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;interpreters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, to support inspecting, creating, and running code in multiple interpreters in the current process. This includes &lt;code class=&quot;docutils literal notranslate&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;Interpreter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; objects that represent the underlying interpreters. The module will also provide a basic &lt;code class=&quot;docutils literal notranslate&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;Queue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; class for communication between interpreters. Finally, we will add a new &lt;code class=&quot;docutils literal notranslate&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;concurrent.futures.InterpreterPoolExecutor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; based on the &lt;code class=&quot;docutils literal notranslate&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pre&quot;&gt;interpreters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; module.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;Both of these enhancements have lots of potential for making Python code faster, more efficient, or both. Peter Sobot &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/psobot/status/1767632346583372082&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; he tried out the GIL removal flag for the pedalboard package and got a 17x speed up for certain processes.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

      "In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.spyder-ide.org/blog/reusable-research-bof-scipy-2023/&quot;&gt;Part 1 of this two-part series&lt;/a&gt;, we went over our motivation and goals for the session and the challenges that attendees brought up.\n",
      "Now, we’ll review the tips, strategies, tools and platforms (including Spyder!) that participants shared as ways to address these obstacles.\n",
      "We'd again like to thank &lt;a href=&quot;https://cfp.scipy.org/2023/speaker/SE7SNC/&quot;&gt;Juanita Gomez&lt;/a&gt; for helping organize the BoF, Hari for his hard work compiling a summary of the outcomes, and everyone for attending and sharing such great ideas and insights!&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;h2&gt;Making notebooks more reusable&lt;/h2&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;As far as reproducibility is concerned, it was brought up that it can be difficult to easily compare outputs between notebooks created by different researchers.\n",
      "In response, one participant mentioned that VSCode recently made &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks#_custom-notebook-diffing&quot;&gt;an improvement&lt;/a&gt; to the notebook diff viewers to more easily show just the code changes.\n",
      "However, users stressed that it was critical to be able to diff the actual notebook output, not just its contents, and expressed a desire for a tool to cover that aspect.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;In response to these concerns, others responded that notebooks should not be considered a unit of reproducible research, which should instead be a complete software project, including notebooks or scripts, an environment/requirements file and a record of commands to run there.\n",
      "They recommended the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anaconda.com/blog/8-levels-of-reproducibility&quot;&gt;8-levels of Reproducibility&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/conda-incubator/conda-project&quot;&gt;Conda Project&lt;/a&gt; to help guide and implement this.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;Additionally, attendees recommended &lt;a href=&quot;https://papermill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&quot;&gt;Papermill&lt;/a&gt;, describing it as a very useful tool for parameterizing and executing notebooks programmatically.\n",
      "Others suggested &lt;a href=&quot;https://containers.dev/&quot;&gt;Devcontainers&lt;/a&gt;, to allow collaborating with a lab group or team in a shared environment and seeing everything on their screen, as well as &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/collaboration/live-share&quot;&gt;Live Share in VSCode&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;Participants also expressed frustration that despite notebooks being intended to make programming more literate, this often does not happen in practice.\n",
      "Beginners like the interactivity in notebooks because they don't know how to use more advanced programming tools, but they don't always take advantage of their readability features.\n",
      "To address this, attendees stressed the importance of getting users accustomed to best practices that can also be helpful for reproducibility.\n",
      "A participant mentioned a &lt;code&gt;nbflake8&lt;/code&gt; tool to lint notebooks, though it could not be easily found online, and others wished for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/1218&quot;&gt;Ruff implementation&lt;/a&gt; (which at the time of this writing is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/5188&quot;&gt;now complete&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;h2&gt;Migrating notebooks to modules&lt;/h2&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;As one participant put it, &quot;I love notebooks, and also love modules, and love the flow of code from notebooks into modules once it approaches that point.&quot;\n",
      "They went on to describe modules as a key unit of documented, tested code, but which doesn't mean a lot on its own, whereas combined with a notebook, it gives them context and meaning.\n",
      "For communities that may be afraid of modules, the participant recommended trying to make creating and transitioning to them easier, so users have fully importable, reusable Python code.\n",
      "For students, notebooks often turn into a fancy scratch pad or script file, and once they get stuff that works, they can move that stuff out into modules, and then the notebooks start to morph into examples and the history of what the work was about that can be interpreted by other researchers.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;Other attendees chimed in with similar stories, with a NIST researcher mentioning this is an area they'd been working on for 10 years, with their approach being putting the stuff they want to be modular in a regular Python module, and then have a Jupyter notebook that shows an example using the code, such as in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/usnistgov/iprPy&quot;&gt;IPRPy project&lt;/a&gt;.\n",
      "To aid this process, participants suggested tools like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=njpwerner.autodocstring&quot;&gt;Autodocstring extension in VSCode&lt;/a&gt; and the docstring generator built into &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.spyder-ide.org/current/panes/editor.html&quot;&gt;Spyder's editor&lt;/a&gt; as great ways to reduce the friction for students when writing documentation, as they just add the triple quotes and the IDE generates a pre-filled docstring for them.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;An important reproducibility and reusability tool many cited for this was &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/fastai/nbdev&quot;&gt;nbdev&lt;/a&gt;, which can allow users to develop their code and let it grow, and then eventually export the parts as modules at the end.\n",
      "According to attendees, its documentation mostly talks about everything as packages, but it can also be used for individual notebooks and modules.\n",
      "Some participants were initially hesitant to show it to their students since they're early Python programmers, but it was actually quite easy for them, only requiring as little as one line of code at the end.\n",
      "(Unfortunately as of this writing, it seems ndbdev development &lt;a href=&quot;https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/nbdev/&quot;&gt;has stalled&lt;/a&gt; due to its expected commercial opportunities not materializing.)\n",
      "Others asked for more documentation resources for this, since they were still learning Python themselves and would like to learn more about this and teach it to their students.\n",
      "In addition to this very blog post and guide, one attendee brought up that they did &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7zS8Ld4_iA&quot;&gt;a tutorial on that topic at SciPy&lt;/a&gt;, adding that the documentation is pretty intimidating but it would be great to have something more focused on smaller-scale usage.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;As additional approaches, attendees mentioned they have their students use &lt;a href=&quot;https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/&quot;&gt;Jupytext&lt;/a&gt;, which helps the student to convert notebooks to Python files that can be committed to a Git repository.\n",
      "This allows the code to be committed as a Python file, while allowing Jupyter to open it as a notebook and continue working on it.\n",
      "Others brought up &lt;a href=&quot;https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html&quot;&gt;nb-convert&lt;/a&gt;, a command line tool that can convert notebooks to many different formats including a Python script, which is integrated into IDEs like Spyder, and that there is also a &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks#_export-your-jupyter-notebook&quot;&gt;similar VSCode feature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;h2&gt;Enabling reusable Python packages&lt;/h2&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;When it comes to overall workflow, all agreed that going from a script or notebook to a reusable, installable Python package could be a major challenge, especially for students and non-programmers.\n",
      "Attendees from NASA mentioned that for their projects everything has to be documented, and one of the things they've struggled with was converting a notebook to the type of report NASA is typically looking for.\n",
      "Others described their workflow being as simple and &quot;old school&quot; as writing a &lt;code&gt;aaa_readme.txt&lt;/code&gt; file where they record a diary of what they were doing on that project so if they have a break working on it, they can go back to those notes and remind themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;To help address this, participants recommended a &quot;really cool&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/showyourwork/showyourwork&quot;&gt;tool called &quot;Show Your Work&quot;&lt;/a&gt; that comes out of the astrophysics community, which is primarily aimed at producing a paper at the end but also a Python package, and includes all the steps that show users' work along the way.\n",
      "It is built around a tool called &lt;a href=&quot;https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/&quot;&gt;Snakemake&lt;/a&gt;, which then sets up a template for both the Python package and the paper.\n",
      "Additionally, attendees described it as having a &quot;really helpful&quot; guide for getting started and ensuring all of a user's projects have the same structure.\n",
      "It was brought up that Azel Donath, maintainer of Gammapy and speaker at SciPy 2023, published &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13584&quot;&gt;their Gammapy paper&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gammapy/gammapy-v1.0-paper&quot;&gt;using this tool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;As a followup, participants asked how this differed from &lt;a href=&quot;https://quarto.org/&quot;&gt;Quarto&lt;/a&gt;, to which the response was that Quarto is much more general, whereas Show Your Work was specifically built to allow users to produce a PDF in LaTeX at the end.\n",
      "Others mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/duecredit/duecredit/&quot;&gt;Duecredit&lt;/a&gt;, a related tool for citing open source authors which looks at code and finds the authors (via Git commits) that wrote it.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;Additionally, users expressed particular appreciation for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scientific-python/cookie&quot;&gt;Cookiecutter template&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&quot;https://iscinumpy.dev/&quot;&gt;Henry Schreiner III&lt;/a&gt; has for packaging.\n",
      "They mentioned that a lot of their workflows are just messing around with their data, and having something like a package structure from the get go helps make it easier to not miss things.\n",
      "As a followup, a nuclear engineer mentioned they often have two week projects leveraging Jupyter at their center, with a cookiecutter template that has Sphinx, and a directory structure, and metadata that looks familiar and has everything set up by default.\n",
      "They described how this particularly helps ensure that different colleagues and team members are on the same page with doing things.\n",
      "Finally, others suggested the &lt;a href=&quot;https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/&quot;&gt;data-driven Cookiecutter template&lt;/a&gt;, which provides an ordered structure for where things go, what they are named and how they are run.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;h2&gt;Next steps&lt;/h2&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve gathered a wealth of community feedback, ideas and resources, we’re currently working to further translate these insights into an actionable guide (or series of such) on a community platform, to make it easier for everyone to apply them.\n",
      "Keep an eye out for that, and until then, happy Spydering!&lt;/p&gt;</description>\n",

Most likely you’ll have used a library such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://realpython.com/python-matplotlib-guide/&quot;&gt;Matplotlib&lt;/a&gt; to produce these. If you want to take your statistical visualizations to the next level, you should master the &lt;a href=&quot;https://seaborn.pydata.org/&quot;&gt;Python seaborn library&lt;/a&gt; to produce impressive statistical analysis plots that will display your data.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

      "&lt;p&gt;Before you use seaborn, you must install it. Open a Jupyter Notebook and type &lt;code&gt;!python -m pip install seaborn&lt;/code&gt; into a new code cell.

Once seaborn is installed, &lt;a href=&quot;https://realpython.com/python-matplotlib-guide/&quot;&gt;Matplotlib&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://realpython.com/learning-paths/pandas-data-science/&quot;&gt;pandas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://realpython.com/numpy-tutorial/&quot;&gt;NumPy&lt;/a&gt; will also be available.

      "&lt;p&gt;First, you import seaborn into your Python code. By convention, you import it as &lt;code&gt;sns&lt;/code&gt;. Although you can use any alias you like, &lt;code&gt;sns&lt;/code&gt; is a nod to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Seaborn&quot;&gt;fictional character&lt;/a&gt; the library was named after.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;To work with data in seaborn, you usually load it into a pandas DataFrame, although &lt;a href=&quot;https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/data_structure.html#data-structures-accepted-by-seaborn&quot;&gt;other data structures&lt;/a&gt; can also be used. The usual way of loading data is to use the pandas &lt;code&gt;read_csv()&lt;/code&gt; function to read data from a file on disk. You’ll see how to do this later.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;To begin with, because you’re working with one of the seaborn sample datasets, seaborn allows you online access to these using its &lt;code&gt;load_dataset()&lt;/code&gt; function. You can see a list of the freely available files on their &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data&quot;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;. To obtain the one you want, all you need to do is pass &lt;code&gt;load_dataset()&lt;/code&gt; a string telling it the name of the file containing the dataset you’re interested in, and it’ll be loaded into a pandas DataFrame for you to use.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;The actual bar plot is created using seaborn’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.barplot.html#seaborn.barplot&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;barplot()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; function. You’ll learn more about the different plotting functions later, but for now, you’ve specified &lt;code&gt;data=tips&lt;/code&gt; as the DataFrame you wish to use and also told the function to plot the &lt;code&gt;day&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tip&lt;/code&gt; columns from it. These contain the day the tip was received and the tip amount, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;The important point you should notice here is that the seaborn &lt;code&gt;barplot()&lt;/code&gt; function, like all seaborn plotting functions, can understand pandas DataFrames instinctively. To specify a column of data for them to use, you pass its column name as a string. There’s no need to write pandas code to identify each Series to be plotted.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;estimator=&quot;mean&quot;&lt;/code&gt; parameter tells seaborn to plot the mean &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; values for each category of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;.  This means your plot will show the average tip for each day. You can quickly customize this to instead use common statistical functions such as &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;max&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;min&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;median&lt;/code&gt;, but &lt;code&gt;estimator=&quot;mean&quot;&lt;/code&gt; is the default. The plot will also show &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_bar&quot;&gt;error bars&lt;/a&gt; by default. By setting &lt;code&gt;errorbar=None&lt;/code&gt;, you can suppress them.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;barplot()&lt;/code&gt; function will produce a plot using the parameters you pass to it, and it’ll label each axis using the column name of the data that you want to see. Once &lt;code&gt;barplot()&lt;/code&gt; is finished, it returns a matplotlib &lt;a href=&quot;https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/axes_api.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Axes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; object containing the plot. To give the plot a title, you need to call the &lt;code&gt;Axes&lt;/code&gt; object’s &lt;code&gt;.set()&lt;/code&gt; method and pass it the title you want. Notice that this was all done from within seaborn directly, and not Matplotlib.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;div class=&quot;alert alert-primary&quot;&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; You may be wondering why the &lt;code&gt;barplot()&lt;/code&gt; function is encapsulated within a pair of parentheses &lt;code&gt;(...)&lt;/code&gt;. This is a coding style often used in seaborn code because it frequently uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_chaining&quot;&gt;method chaining&lt;/a&gt;. These extra brackets allow you to horizontally align method calls, starting each with its dot notation. Alternatively, you could use the backslash (&lt;code&gt;\\&lt;/code&gt;) for line continuation, although that is &lt;a href=&quot;https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#maximum-line-length&quot;&gt;discouraged&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;If you take another look at the code, the alignment of &lt;code&gt;.set()&lt;/code&gt; is only possible because of these extra encasing brackets. You’ll see this coding style used throughout this tutorial, as well as when you read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://seaborn.pydata.org/&quot;&gt;seaborn documentation&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;/div&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;In some environments like &lt;a href=&quot;https://realpython.com/ipython-interactive-python-shell/&quot;&gt;IPython&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://realpython.com/pycharm-guide/&quot;&gt;PyCharm&lt;/a&gt;, you may need to use Matplotlib’s &lt;code&gt;show()&lt;/code&gt; function to display your plot, meaning you must import Matplotlib into Python as well. If you’re using a Jupyter notebook, then using &lt;code&gt;plt.show()&lt;/code&gt; isn’t necessary, but using it removes some unwanted text above your plot. Placing a semicolon (&lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;) at the end of &lt;code&gt;barplot()&lt;/code&gt; will also do this for you.  &lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;When you run the code, the resulting plot will look like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;a href=&quot;https://files.realpython.com/media/ie_daily_tips.53d0cdb6eb5d.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid mx-auto d-block &quot; src=&quot;https://files.realpython.com/media/ie_daily_tips.53d0cdb6eb5d.png&quot; width=&quot;708&quot; height=&quot;561&quot; alt=&quot;Barplot showing a waiter's daily tips.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n",
      "\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;As you can see, the waiter’s daily average tips rise slightly on the weekends. It looks as though people tip more when they’re relaxed.&lt;/p&gt;\n",
      "&lt;div class=&quot;alert alert-primary&quot;&gt;\n",
      "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; One thing you should be aware of is that &lt;code&gt;load_dataset()&lt;/code&gt;, unlike &lt;code&gt;read_csv()&lt;/code&gt;, will automatically convert string columns into the pandas &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/categorical.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Categorical&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; data type for you. You use this where your data contains a limited, fixed number of possible values. In this case, the &lt;code&gt;day&lt;/code&gt; column of data will be treated as a &lt;code&gt;Categorical&lt;/code&gt; data type containing the days of the week. You can see this by using &lt;code&gt;tips[&quot;day&quot;]&lt;/code&gt; to view the column:&lt;/p&gt;\n",

      "&lt;p&gt;Python versions 3.12 and 3.11 receive a &lt;strong&gt;security fix&lt;/strong&gt;, and CPython source distributions now document the &lt;strong&gt;software supply chain&lt;/strong&gt; to allow for a more effective vulnerability detection.
